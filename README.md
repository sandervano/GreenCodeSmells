# GreenCodeSmells
A framework for estimating the energy consumption on a linux computer using the RAPL counters.

The framework was developed for a Bachelor Thesis on measuring the difference in the impact on the energy consumption of code smells for different programming languages.

This framework uses an modified version of rapl-read.c sourced from: https://github.com/deater/uarch-configure.
